* GitHub is a development platform that enables you to host and review code, manage projects, and build software. 
* It provides the important DevOps features like planning features, fixing bugs, or collaborating on changes.

* [The GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) - a workflow designed to optimize use of its various features. 

* [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git) is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows multiple developers to work on a project. It provides a way to work with one or more local branches and push them to a remote repository. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. Key features: It's installed and used on your local machine, Handles version control, Supports branching

* [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github) - is a cloud platform that uses Git as its core technology. Key features: Issues, Discussions, Pull requests, Notifications, Labels, Actions, Forks, Projects

* [Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) - are where most of the communication between a consumers and development. An issue may be bug reports, feature requests, documentation clarifications, and more. It can be assigned to owners, labels, projects, and milestones. You can also associate issues with pull requests and other GitHub items to provide future traceability.

* [Notifications](https://help.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/configuring-notifications) - for virtually every event that takes place within a given workflow. These notifications can be finely tuned to meet your preferences. To keep track of all of your notificationscts, use the [dashboard](https://github.com/notifications).

* [Branches](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) - create changes in the GitHub flow, so that multiple people may simultaneously work on the same code in a controlled way. It may be merged to main brach via pull request.
![](img/1/2-branching.png)

* [Commits](https://help.github.com/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project) - is a change to one or more files on a branch. It provides a clear audit trail for anyone reviewing the history of a file or linked item, such as an issue or pull request.
![](img/1/2-commits.png)

* [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) - is the mechanism used to signal that the commits from one branch are ready to be merged into another branch. Reviewers to verify the code and approve the merge. Once the changes have been approved (if approval is required), the pull request's source branch (the compare branch) may be merged in to the base branch.

* [Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-labels) - categorize and organize issues and pull requests in a repository. Examples of Labels: bug, documentation, duplicate, help wanted, enhancement, question
![](img/1/2-labels.png)

* [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions) - provide task automation and workflow functionality in a repository. Actions can be used to streamline processes in your SDLC and implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). GitHub Actions are composed of the following components:
    1. Workflows: Automated processes added to your repository.
    2. Events: An activity that triggers a workflow.
    3. Jobs: A set of steps that execute on a runner.
    4. Steps: A task that can run one or more commands (actions).
    5. Actions: Standalone commands that can be combined into steps. Multiple steps can be combined to create a job.
    6. Runners: Server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed.

* Cloning a Repository - Cloning a repository will make a copy of the repository and its history on your local machine. 

* [Forking a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) - Forking a repository(upstream) makes a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. To contribute changes back to the upstream repository, you create a pull request from your forked repository.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - is a hosting engine that's built right into your GitHub account. Build your own static site generated from HTML and markdown code pulled directly from your repository.

# Migrating to GitHub
1. Retain version-control history, import using the GitHub Migrator tool.
2. Handling binary files currently stored in your project - Avoid committing large binary files (spreadsheets, presentations) such as build artifacts. Need to version large binary files, consider using the Git LFS (Large File Storage) Git extension
3. Creating important Git files like .gitignore - recursively excludes any folders called Bin or bin
    1. .gitignore
    2. [Bb]in/
4. Importing your project to GitHub - Ready for migration, navigate to the Code tab of your GitHub repository. Use the Import code option to specify the source repository.

6. The GitHub Migrator tool will take care of the rest.

# What are merge conflicts?
* Developer creates a branch named "feature-branch" based off "main" and creates two commits. As this work is happening, someone else merges an unrelated pull request into main. 
* If the feature-branch commits don't overlap with parallel commits made to main since the branch was created, then there will be no problems.
* But if both sets of commits include changes to the same lines of code? This merge attempt would fail due to a <ins>merge conflict</ins>.
* ![](img/1/2-merge-conflict.png)
* <ins>What are merge conflicts?</ins> - Developer attempts to merge changes (overwrite parallel). Git won't automatically overwrite, it will point the conflict, so that developer can resolve.
* ![](img/1/2-yes-merge-conflicts.png)
* <ins>Resolving merge conflicts</ins> - GitHub generates a temporary hybrid file that includes the differences from each branch. Cmpare branch is shown above the base branch, separated by a line of equal signs (=======).
* ![](img/1/2-resolving-merge-conflict.png)
* Directly edit the file if the changes are minor. If you decide to keep the final result, it will be committed to the compare branch.
* Avoiding merge conflicts
    1. Pull early and often
    2. Tidying history with git rebase - "git rebase (or git pull --rebase)" command.
