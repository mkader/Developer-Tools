# components of Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL?
* <ins>Accounts</ins> - fundamental units of distribution and high availability. At the account level, configure the region[s] for your data & set the default consistency level for requests. Accounts also contain the globally unique DNS name used for API requests. 
* <ins>Databases</ins> -  Each account can contain one or more Databases. A database is a logical unit of management for containers
* <ins>Containers</ins> - fundamental unit of scalability. At the container level, provision throughput and Optionally configure an indexing policy or a default time-to-live value. Cosmos will automatically and transparently partition the data in a container.
* <ins>Items</ins> - The NoSQL API for stores individual documents in JSON format as items within the container. Cosmos can provide fast and predictable performance because write operations on JSON documents are atomic.

* Partitioning & Partition Keys
    1. Partitioning involves writing data to servers in a way that optimizes both reads and writes.
    2. Azure Cosmos DB stores data in virtual buckets called logical partitions.
    3. It relies on a partition key to determine which of these buckets to put new data in and where to look for data during a query.

    * When choosing a key, following three guidelines.
        1. Find the write balance - Test your partition key to see how it distributes writes. The goal is to avoid hotspots and rate limits by achieving even distribution of storage and throughput across logical partitions.
        2. Aim for a single partition query. Look to see how many partitions get hit when you run your most frequent queries. Ideally, you want to avoid the cost and latency of involving multiple
partitions, by choosing a key that queries a single partition.

Three, understand
cross-partition query trade offs.
If you do run cross-partition queries
for less important workloads
every once in a while,
it won't impact your overall experience.
But if it's more than
that, you can use an array
of discrete values for the
partition keys in your query
to target a subset of partitions.
Looking to unlock the
scale and performance
of Azure Cosmos DB?
Remember it's all about the partition key.

Every Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL container is required to specify a partition key path. Behind the scenes, Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL uses this path to logically partition data using partition key values. For example, consider the following JSON document:

JSON

Copy
{
  "id": "35b5bf7d-5f0e-4209-b7cb-8c5c70c3bb59",
  "deviceDisplayName": "shared-printer",
  "acquiredYear": 2019,
  "department": {
    "name": "information-technology",
    "metadata": {
      "location": "floor-5-unit-27"
    }
  },
  "queuedDocuments": [
    {
      "sender": "user-293749329",
      "sentTime": "2019-07-26T05:12:37",
      "pages": 5,
      "spoolRef": "3f4b759c-3230-4269-a88e-de7620ad91c0"
    },
    {
      "device": {
        "type": "mobile"
      },
      "sentTime": "2019-11-12T13:08:42",
      "spoolRefs": [
        "6a86682c-be5a-4a4a-bacd-96c4d1c7ece6",
        "79e78fe2-93aa-4688-89db-a7278b034aa6"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
If your container specifies a partition key path of /department/name, then the partition key value of this document would be information-technology. Behind the scenes, Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL automatically manages the physical resources necessary to support your data workload.

Selecting a partition key path for a container can be one of the most important design decisions for a new workload. Review the choosing a partition key documentation for a deeper technical explanation and best practices.
